Oh, she's my baby 
Let me tell you why 
Hey, she drives me crazy 
She's the apple of my eye 
'Cause she is my girl 
And she can never do wrong 
If I dream too much at night 
Somebody please bring me down 

Hey, I love that little lady 
I got to be her fool 
Ain't no other like my baby 
I can break the golden rule 
'Cause I get down on my knees 
Oh, I pray that love won't die 
And if I always try to please 
I don't know the reason why, yeah 

If she would come back 
Only stay with me, oh yeah 

Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of my love, a pretty girl 
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of my love, oh

I don't have to go by plane 
I ain't gotta go by car 
I don't care just where my darling is 
People I just don't care how far 
I'm gonna crawl, I'm gonna crawl
I don't care if I got to go back home 
I don't care what I got to stand to her back 
I'm gonna crawl, I'm gonna crawl 
Ah, I'm gonna move the car, baby 
Ah, she give me good lovin', she give me good lovin' 
She give me good lovin', she give me good lovin', my baby give me good lovin'
Yes, I love her, I guess I love her, yes, I love her 
I'm gonna crawl
