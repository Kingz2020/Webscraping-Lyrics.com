Oh, nobody's fault but mine 
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight 
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine 

The devil he told me to roll 
The devil he told me to roll 
How to roll the log tonight 
Nobody's fault but mine 

Brother he showed me the gong? 
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong 
How to keep that gong alive
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine 

Got a monkey on my back
Got a mo, mo, mo, mo, monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight 
Nobody's fault but mine 

I will get down rollin' tonight
No-no-no-no-no-no-nobody's fault
