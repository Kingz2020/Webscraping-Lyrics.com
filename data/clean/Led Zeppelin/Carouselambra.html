Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast 
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed 
But no one seemed to question in anyway
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
But no one there had heaven within their reach
Singing uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Oh, oh, oh 

Oh, oh 

Oh

Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow
Bow

Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip, throw down the key

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed

They had to stay
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take off the fruit, but guard the seed

Take off the fruit, but guard the seed
