Oh come on baby give me some 

When I see you at that dance with your tight dress on

Oh, come on baby be my baby 
Come on, come on come oh 
Darlene, oh, Darlene, hey hey Darlene, oh oh 
Come back and be my sweet little girl 
When I see you on the street, it makes my heart go flitter 
I see you walkin' with all those guys 
It makes me feel so sick 

And I don't care what people say 
And I don't care what they do 
Sweet child I gotta make you mine 
You're the only thing that I want: You! 
Baby baby when you walk down the block, 
See the people behind (?) 
Woh child oh ya drive me wild

Oh baby, I got my car

I'm gonna take you every place 
I'm gonna boogie-woogie-woogie-woogie that's fine 

I'm gonna prove it, Darlene 
I'm gonna make ya my girl 
I'm gonna boogie, Darlene 
I'm gonna send ya in another world 

'Cause I love Darlene, I gotta love 'er,

I gotta give it all back to you

Oh but I love Darlene?
'Cause I love, yes I do ?

I've been tryin' to get a hold of you
And I love you Darlene
Yes I love you I do
