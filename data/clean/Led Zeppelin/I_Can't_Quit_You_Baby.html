We-ell, I can't quit you baby
But I got to put you down a little while
We-ell, I can't quit you baby
But I got to put you down a little while
We-ell you done made me mess up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child

Ah, when you hear me moanin' and groanin'
Whoa you know it hurts me way down inside
Whoa when you hear me moanin' and groanin'
You know it hurts way down inside
Oh when you hear me howlin'
Ooh you know my love will never die, alright

Well when you see me cryin'
Don't let my tears fall in vain
Well when you see me cryin, darlin'
Please don't let my tears fall in vain
Lord, I don't know what to do
You know my heart is filled with pain

Whoa, when you hear me howlin'
Baby, you know it hurts way down inside
