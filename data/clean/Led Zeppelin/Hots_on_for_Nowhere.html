I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted,
(And a) tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder,
Event I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me f*ck all

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

On the corner of Bleeker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver ran down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So I looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

Oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe
I lost my way

Hey babe, hey babe
I really, really, really

Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm gonna find it

Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?

Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right

Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right

Now my babe
Let me tell you
It just feels, it just feels, it just feels, it just feels so good
So good, so good
oh yeah
