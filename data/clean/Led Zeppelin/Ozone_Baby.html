I hear ya knock on my door 
I ain't been saving this scene for ya honey 
Don't wantcha ringin' my bell 
It's too late for you to be my honey 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Don't want you wasting my time 
Tired of ya doing the things that you do 
It's no use standing in line 
Follow the line, you better follow queue 

I say, oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my my own

I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead
I could I wish for a million, yeah but I know it's dead
I could cry within the darkness, I sail away 
I save a lifetime forever?
But you know, you know, you know what I say 

And I say oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my my own 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my own true love
My own true love, my own true love
My own true love
I said Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love
Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my own
