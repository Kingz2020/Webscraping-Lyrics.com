The sun shall not smite I by day
Nor the moon by night
And everything that I do
Shall be up-full and right

And if it's all night
It got to be (alright)
(Talking to you) all night
(It got to be) alright

I'ma not lose this one
I'm the lucky one, under the sun
If you make me move
Then you know, we got to groove

Ah, do ya like it?
Ah, do ya like it?
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?

If it's all night
Got to be alright
I'm workin' all night
Got to be alright

See (all night), I work for my pay
(Alright), night and day
(All night) work for my pay (alright), night and day
(No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh)
Can't you feel it (no, no, no, no, no, ooh, no, no, no, no, no, ooh)
If it's, if it's, if it's, it's got to be (alright)
If it's (all night), if it's (alright)
Do you like it (alright)
I talk old (alright), square our fold
Break it back, tear a drop
Wipe a tears from your eyes, and don't ya cry
Wipe them lonely tears, baby
I'll tell you why

If it's all night, got to be (alright)
If it's all night, got to be (alright)
(Alright) know that I'm a stranger in your town
