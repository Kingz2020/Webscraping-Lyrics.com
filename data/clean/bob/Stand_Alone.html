There you are, cryin' again
But your loveliness won't cover your shame
There you are, you're takin' true love
And while you're takin' true love, you givin' the blame

(How could I) could I be so wrong
To think that we could get along?
Days I wasted with you, child
If I count there'll be a million or two
Now I stand alone through the memories
That haunts me, that haunt
Yeah, and I walk alone through the rhapsodies
That taunts me, that taunts me, me

There you are, cryin' again
But your loveliness won't cover your shame
There you are, you're takin' true love
And while you're takin' true love, you givin' the blame

(How could I) how could I be so wrong
To think that we could get along?
Days I wasted with you, child
If I count there'll be a million or two
Now I stand alone through the memories
That haunts me, that haunts (me)
And I walk alone through the rhapsodies
That taunts me, that taunts me

Now, there you are, cryin' again
But your loveliness won't cover your shame, hey
There you are, you're takin' true love
While you're takin' true love, you givin' the blame
