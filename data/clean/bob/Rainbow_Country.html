Hey Mr. Music
Ya sure sound good to me
I can't refuse it
What got to be, got to be

Feel like dancing
Dance 'cause we are free

I got my home
In the promise land
But I feel at home
Can you understand

Said the road is rocky
Sure feels good to me
And if your lucky
Together we'd always be

I will ride it
The sun is a risin'
The sign is a rising
Are you really riding?
Are you really riding?

Are you really riding?
Are you really riding?

Sure feels good to me
And if I'm lucky

The sun is a risin'
Moon is a risin'

I will ride it
I will ride it

I will ride it
I will ride it

And though the road is rocky
Sure feels good to me
And if I'm lucky
Together we'd always be

I will ride it
