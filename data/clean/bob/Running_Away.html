But ya can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself 
Can't run away from yourself 
Can't run away from yourself 
Can't run away from yourself

Ya running and ya running
And ya running away
Ya running and ya running

You must have done somethin' 
Somethin' somethin' somethin' 
Somethin' ya don't want nobody to know about
Ya must have, Lord, somethin' wrong,
What ya must have done, ya must have done somethin' wrong
Why you can't find where you belong?

Well, well, well, well, ya running away, heh, no 
Ya running away, ooh, no, no, no
I'm not (running away), no, don't say that, don't say that
'Cause (running away) I'm not running away, ooh (running away)
I've got to protect my life, (running away)
And I don't want to live with no strife (running away)
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion (running away)
So, I made my decision and I left ya (running away)
And now you comin' to tell me
That I'm runnin' away (running away)
But it's not true
I am not runnin' away (running away)
