Every man gotta right to decide his own destiny
And in this judgment there is no partiality
So arm in arms, with arms 
We'll fight this little struggle
'Cause that's the only way 
We can overcome our little trouble

Brother you're right, you're right,
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We gon' fight (We gon' fight)
We'll have to fight (We gon' fight)
We gonna fight (We gon' fight)
Fight for our rights!

Natty dread it in-a (Zimbabwe)
Set it up in (Zimbabwe)
Mash it up-a in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans a-liberate (Zimbabwe)

No more internal power struggle 
We come together to overcome the little trouble
Soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionary
'Cause I don't want my people to be contrary

And brother you're right, you're right,
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We'll have to fight (We gon' fight)
We gonna fight (We gon' fight)
We'll have to fight (We gon' fight)
Fighting for our rights

Mash it up in-a (Zimbabwe)
Natty trash it in-a (Zimbabwe)
Africans a-liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
I'n'I a-liberate Zimbabwe

Brother you're right, you're right,
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We gon' fight (We gon' fight) 
We'll have to fight (We gon' fight) 
We gonna fight (We gon' fight)
Fighting for our rights

To divide and rule could only tear us apart
In everyman chest, there beats a heart
So soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionary
And I don't want my people to be tricked by mercenaries

Brother you're right, you're right,
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We'll have to fight (We gon' fight)
We gonna fight (We gon' fight) 
We'll have to fight (We gon' fight)
Fighting for our rights

Natty trash it in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Mash it up in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Set it up in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans a-liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans a-liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Natty dub it in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Set it up in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans a-liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Every man got a right to decide his own destiny
