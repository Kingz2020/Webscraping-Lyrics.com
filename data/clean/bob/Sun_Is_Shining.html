Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you wanna move your dancing feet now
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know ya, can you understand

When the morning gather the rainbow, yeah, yeah
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know ya
Can you, can you, can you understand

The sun is shining, the weather is sweet now
Make you wanna move your dancing feet, yeah
Oh, to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Here I stand, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Can you understand me now, baby

Do you believe me?
