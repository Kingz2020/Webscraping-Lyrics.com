3,Bob Marley,"Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet

Woman hold her head and cry
Explaining to her was a passerby
Who saw the woman cry (cry)
Wondering
How can she work it out 
Now she knows that the wages of sin is death, yeah!
Gift of Jah is life (life) 

She cried 
Ah-um, I, I know!
Johnny was a good man 
I, I know! (never did a thing wrong)
Johnny was a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good man
(Johnny was good man) He cried, he cried

Wo-ooh! Woman hold her head and cry
As her son had been shot down in the street and died
Just because of the system (system)

Woman hold her head and cry
Comforting her I was passing by
She complained, then she cry

Oh-whoah 
yeah, I know now, I know, I know now (Johnny was a good man)
Said I know, hmm (Never did a thing wrong)

5,Bob Marley,"I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)
Yeah! All around in my home town,
They're tryin' to track me down;
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:

Oh, now, now. Oh!
(I shot the sheriff.) - the sheriff.
(But I swear it was in selfdefence.)
Oh, no! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!
I say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -
(And they say it is a capital offence.)
Yeah! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!

Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know:
Every time I plant a seed,
He said kill it before it grow -
He said kill them before they grow.
And so:

Read it in the news:
(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!
(But I swear it was in self-defence.)
Where was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)
I say: I shot the sheriff,
But I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:
If I am guilty I will pay.

(I shot the sheriff,)
But I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy),
I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!
(I shot the sheriff.) I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)

Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be:
Every day the bucket a-go a well,
One day the bottom a-go drop out,
One day the bottom a-go drop out.
I say:

I - I - I - I shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!
I - I (shot the sheriff) -
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!"
6,Bob Marley,"Stop that train, I'm leavin' today!
Stop that train, I'm leavin' anyway!
Stop that train, I'm leavin'
And I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teachin' my people who don't understand
And even though I tried my best
I still can't find no happiness

So I got to say
Stop that train, I'm leavin' oh, baby now!
Stop that train, I'm leavin', I don't care what you say!
Stop that train, I'm leavin'
And I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some goin' east, and-a some goin' to west
Some stand aside to try their best
Some livin' big, but the most is livin' small
They just can't even find no food at all

I mean, stop it
Stop that train, I'm leavin', believe me, mm-hmm
Stop that train, I'm leavin', I don't mind!
Stop that train, I'm leavin'
And I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train, I'm leavin', believe me
Stop that train, I'm leavin', can't take it!
Stop that train, I'm leavin', got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong"

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waiting feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
'Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
'Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
And I'm still waiting there

Like I said
It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door
And I still can knock some more
Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, 'for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn
See

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

Slave for this country?
Now you look me with that scorn
Then you eat up all my corn

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase them crazy 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town
 
Build your penitentiary
We build your schools
Brainwash education 
To make us the fools
Hate is your reward for our love
Telling us of your God above

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase those crazy bunkheads 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town

Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase those crazy bunkheads 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town

Which hold one race superior and another
Inferior
Is finally

Until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
Me say war

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

That until that day
The dream of lasting peace,
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,
But never attained
Now everywhere is war
War

And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
War war
Rumors of war
And until that day,
The African continent
Will not know peace,
We Africans will fight we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory

With his top hap and walking-stick?

The cow jumping over the moon
While the dish got jealous, he grabbed the handy spoon

To all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible
To go living through the past
Don't tell no lie

Can't keep them down

Look, how long (wo-o-o-o)

(fools don't see, fools don't see. Wo-o-o-o)
I can't save the youth:
The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong.
So, won't you come with me;
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live - live a good, good life
And be free.

Look how long: 400 years, (400 years, 400 years) -
Way too long! (wo-o-o-o)

Trying to belittle our integrity now
They say what we know
Is just what they teach us
And we're so ignorant
'Cause every time they can reach us (shoobe, doowa)
Through political strategy (shoobe, doowa)
They keep us hungry (shoobe, doowa)
And when you gonna get some food (shoobe, doowa)
Your brother got to be your enemy, well

In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba observing the hypocrites

Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say and 

No, woman, no cry

As it was log wood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone, I mean

And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while

Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
(Till now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was till now"

Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home.
You had romance, did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
Mm, that's my home.
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?

But I love them and I leave them,
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,

And angels sing

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you

Want to see you for always

Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat!

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me (from this living hell)
Save me (cause I don't wanna know)
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
""I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair""
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?

115,Michael Jackson,"La la la la la la, la la la la la la
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

116,Michael Jackson,"I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white

Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight

With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just wanna scream

I'm tired of you telling the story your way
You're causing confusion, you think it's okay, damn it
You keep changing up rules, while I keep playing the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane

With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
So Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (all the injustice)

With such delusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme

119,Michael Jackson,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood"
120,Michael Jackson,"Hee, hee, hee

My baby's always dancin'
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin'
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance

I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
(Don't you blame it)

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times

You just want to (good times)
Yeah, oh (boogie)

Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)

On all night long (boogie)

Yours and that boogie (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will

Stab me in the back
In the face

All your glory

I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

128,Michael Jackson,"I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
Kgb was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow (Lord have mercy)
Like a stranger in Moscow (Lord have mercy)
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow"
129,Michael Jackson,"Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there

She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair"

131,Michael Jackson,"Do you remember 
When we fell in love
We were so young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
(Tell me)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk
(Ya know)
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby!

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Remember the times
Ooh
Remember the times
Do you remember girl
Remember the times
On the phone you and me
Remember the times
Till dawn, two or three
What about us girl

Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
In the park, on the beach
Remember the times
You and me in Spain
Remember the times
What about, what about...

Remember the times
Ooh...in the park
Remember the times
After dark...Do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Yeah yeah"
132,Michael Jackson,"Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way"
133,Michael Jackson,"It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters

She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming?

Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, strike a flame in me

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

(When you call my name)
It's torture
(It's heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

(When you call my name)
It's torture
(Heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey"
134,Michael Jackson,"Close my eyes and I see your face at night
Toss and turn, fall to sleep holding my pillow tight
All the time I think of you
You're with me no matter what I do

Walk around with a smile upon my face
In my mind you have taken up permanent space
I am feeling what I can't explain
And if what you're feeling is the same

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

S E R I O U S, baby
Let's get serious
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In your arms is the place I want to be
With my love in you and your love inside of me
Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we've got so much love we want to share

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
And fall in love

135,Michael Jackson,"Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I want to rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I want to rock with you (all night)
Rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I want to rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I want to rock with you (all night)
Rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on

I want to rock (all night) with you girl (sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (yeah) (all night)

136,Michael Jackson,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone (you are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)
(You and me) I am here to stay

For you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
For I am here with you though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone not alone, oh"

Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight zone and?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)

142,Michael Jackson,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
Nothing to fear fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
La la la
A place without no name
La la la

A place without no name (La, la, la)"

That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine"

'light coming from your eyes
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

I know I've been here before
You go, then you come back for more
It's a mystery how you disappear
Like a shadow in the night
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

[Chorus]
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Midnight images of you
You slipped, slipped into my room
Could be magic, could be fantasy
Could it be that we're in love
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Your voice whispers in the dark
You talk, talking to my heart
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

[Chorus]

When the morning comes
Wake me with your love
Let me know that I'm not dreamin'
Tell me this is real
Show me how you feel
Say it's what we both believe in

[Chorus]"
147,Michael Jackson,"It's close to midnight 
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight 
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze 
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah

Ooh, ooh
You hear the door slam 
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand 
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes 
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while 
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you 
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time 
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night 
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller"

149,Michael Jackson,"Now I'm just wondering 
Why you think that you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through
I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me (come on)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Now you can't stop me even thought you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes (yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?

You can't let it break, 'cause I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same, I'm (uh) unbreakable (uh, what? uh)

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello?
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack bragging, sick of bragging how my mink be dragging
Desert Eag's, street sweeper inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil
What

154,Michael Jackson,"Tonight's story is somewhat unique 
And calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? 
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (everywhere)
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me (no, no)

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never land, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened

You should be 
Feel threatened
While you sleep
Be threatened
Every time 
Threatened
Half of me 
So you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

What you have just witnessed 
Could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't
It's the beginning"
155,Michael Jackson,"Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we
Ben most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to'
I'm sure they'd think again if they had a friend like Ben
A friend like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben"

Come on back

Maria ooh baby

157,Michael Jackson,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Woah oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
There's no in fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
Grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
We're in a world that I wanna lead

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name"
158,Michael Jackson,"I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watchin' snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that waiting there is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a little prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(And I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you have to leave me)

Oh, little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve"

But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 

It's a new day, a new age 
A photograph is taken, its ready one minute later 
Cars are bigger and better 
Manufacture satisfy
Any world full of crime 
I can't let you take

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 
No, no 

So you want to be a star 
I think you are 
You don't have to go further 
Then my loving arms 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 

Are you sure you want to go to New York City (New York City) 
Where girls make it big if their pretty (if their pretty) 
Let say you get that penthouse view 
But whose gonna love you the way I do (just the way I do) 

It's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
No, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
It's too late, too late to change the time 
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

Too late, too late"
160,Michael Jackson,"They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't want to see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't want to see no blood, don't be a macho man
You want to be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you want to be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't want to be a boy, you want to be a man
You want to stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you want to be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

161,Michael Jackson,"I'm gonna make a change,
For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good,
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
(Starting with me!)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways

I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you want to make the world a better place)

(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your, your mind!
(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man,
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know, that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place

Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Come on!
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it,
Yourself!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've got to make that change, today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself
Brother
Hoo!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know I've got to get
That man, that man

(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move! Come on!
Come on!
You got to

Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Aw!

Gonna make that change

Come on!

163,Michael Jackson,"There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
A better way for us to survive
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more than meets the eye
What good is life, if in the end we all must die
There must be more to life than this

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this
I live in hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this"
164,Michael Jackson,"He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around"
165,Michael Jackson,"She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

And she's, out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
I kept my love for her locked, deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my, life"
166,Michael Jackson,"There you were
Standing there
As your eyes reached out to me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart right then and there
All the love I never knew
I found in you
Suddenly
My world stood still
My life was then forfilled
As you gently touched my hand
I knew that we had laying a plan
For everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (A paradise)
It came today
Forever came today

As we were standing there
You didn't speak a single word
But your eyes
Your eyes said you wanted me
Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly
Darling
Ooh, my darling
Make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has let me
To this place to your warm embrace
And our hapiness
Thanks to you my search has ended
And I want the world to see
How gently love has shined on me
With everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (A paradise)
It came today
Forever came today

Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (A paradise)

Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place

But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you

For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Keep on, with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force don't stop

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before

Like I before E except after C

And why two plus two makes four
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you
Teach you, teach you

All about love, dear
All about love

Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl!

Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
I'm a going to teach how to sing it out!
Michael, come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

Reading, writing and arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree

But without the roots of love every day, girl

Your education ain't complete
T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you

Show you, show you

How to get an A!

Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl!
ABC
It's easy,
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be!

Sit down, girl!
I think I love you!
No!
Get up, girl!
Show me what you can do!

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now!
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh ooh!
Shake it shake it, baby, huh!

175,Michael Jackson,"Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home instead

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do ('cause you're always on my mind)"
176,Michael Jackson,"I don't know how many stars there are
Up in the heavenly sky
I only know my heaven is here on earth
Each time you look into my eyes
The way you do baby

Thank you thank you baby
My beautiful bird you have flown away
I held you to tight I can see

You're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you

You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl

Maybe she won't
Maybe you're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby, cause

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you

You are the four seasons of my life (life)
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Sing it sing it

You are the four seasons of my life (life)
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl

Maybe tomorrow"
177,Michael Jackson,"Why don't you believe me when I say that i love you? 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
You wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain't true 
I'm all about you 
You're my desire 
I get higher every time I speak your name 
That's all I do 
And the way that I can't sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don't love, when it's giving my love pains 
It's the hurt and the tension 
Girl, it's driving me insane 
 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
 
Why don't you believe me when I say that I am true 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
I'm here to love and please you, I'll do what you want me to 
I'm all about you 
Living and hoping, but I'm coping 
With these things you put me through 
That's all I do 
The way that I can't sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty,

178,Michael Jackson,"As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment

180,Michael Jackson,"I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone (She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

I never would've thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone (She was loving me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife (She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why, oh no
Alright
Oh (I'm in love, love)

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holding her blame

She said she didn't have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone (Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (Holding her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me (Holding her to blame)

181,Michael Jackson,"The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine"

it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear

Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things

That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin')

You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aw

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Yeah yeah!
Don't understand it
You just a dog gone
Aw

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aw

Who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Aw
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy"
188,Michael Jackson,"There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

You and for me"
189,Michael Jackson,"Live and sin 
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
 
Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other 
 
Someone's evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile's trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He's been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue, 
Every girl that I knew 
And my baby said love is through 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel"
190,Michael Jackson,"Uh ohh

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night

That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around

You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now

If you look around
The whole world's coming together now, baby
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Feel it in the air, the wind is taking it everywhere, yeah
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

All the colors of the world should be that
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother, when hate won't do
'Cause we're all the same, yes, the blood inside me is inside you
Now tell me

Can you feel it, (tell me can you feel it) can you feel it, can you feel it
(Can you see what's going down? Can you feel it in your bones?)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Yeah, yeah

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters, show we know how
Now tell me

Can you feel it, (tell me can you feel it) can you feel it, can you feel it

Tell the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
Yes, we're all the same

Oh, yeah
Crazy dream, uh-huh
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song
Yeah, people don't you listen now?
Sing along
Oh
You don't know what you're missing, now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow, push push, yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh

Here we go, here we go
All you gotta do, now
All you gotta do, now
Ooh-ee
Sing out Hare-Hare
Ooh, dance the Hoochie-Koo
City lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding

That's all right now mama, anyway you do
I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure

Me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do"
196,Led Zeppelin,"Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going To California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings
La la la la
Side a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems"
197,Led Zeppelin,"Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby
What do you what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey Boy do you want to score?
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind.
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said
Please, hey, would we care to all get in line
Get in line
Well you know
They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, oh
Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not trying to fight it

You really don't care if they're coming oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, oh.
If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care
Don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, oh, I really don't know"
198,Led Zeppelin,"As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this song
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, is oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away 
There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I am 
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man 
One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun trying to flag a ride 
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race 
And the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love

There she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59
I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
Wow! She's somethin' else"
200,Led Zeppelin,"I've been to London, seen seven wonders I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for
There can be no denying, that the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying, and there's a new plague on the land

(If we could just join hands)
(If we could just join)

Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me 
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe

(If we could just join hands)

You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry, and I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder, of earthly plunder, will it leave us anything to show
And our time is flying, see the candle burning low
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old

(If we could just join hands)
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands

I see the smiling faces

210,Led Zeppelin,"Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast 
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed 
But no one seemed to question in anyway
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
But no one there had heaven within their reach
Singing uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Oh, oh, oh 

Oh, oh 

Oh

Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow
Bow

Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip, throw down the key

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed

They had to stay
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take off the fruit, but guard the seed

Take off the fruit, but guard the seed"

One minute seems like a lifetime

Time moves so slow 
I've been watchin' for the hands to move 
Until I just can't look no more 
How come twenty four hours

A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way 

To sing a song for you 
I recall you used to say 
Oh baby this one's for we two
Which in the end is you anyway 

How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way 

There was a time that I stood tall 
In the eyes of other men 
But by my own choice I left you woman 
And now I can't get back again 

How come twenty-four hours 
Sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah

Can the people hear

Oh, the people turned away

Down in the city streets, 
See all the folk go racin', racin'
No time left, to pass the time of day

The people turned away 
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run, 
See how they run, see how they run

Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I want to tell you 
Some go twistin' every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell

Out in the country, 
Hear the people singin'
Singin' 'bout their progress 
Knowin' where they're goin'

Oh, oh, the people turned away
Yes, the people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine 
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for lady nature 
And she will come back again
The people turned away
The people turned away"

217,Led Zeppelin,"(Oh, hot dog)
Well, I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the general store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said ""you-haul"" 
She left angels hangin' round for more 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
But they just rolled my doll right out the door"
218,Led Zeppelin,"Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, oh

All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din

For me, the cloth once more to spin, oh

All of my love to you

All of my love, all of my love, yes

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time

Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear

And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
Like Shangri-la beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay yeah

Oh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Oh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby, let me take you there
Come on, come on, oh, let me take you there, let me take you there"
228,Led Zeppelin,"We-ell, I can't quit you baby
But I got to put you down a little while
We-ell, I can't quit you baby
But I got to put you down a little while
We-ell you done made me mess up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child

Ah, when you hear me moanin' and groanin'
Whoa you know it hurts me way down inside
Whoa when you hear me moanin' and groanin'
You know it hurts way down inside
Oh when you hear me howlin'
Ooh you know my love will never die, alright

Well when you see me cryin'
Don't let my tears fall in vain
Well when you see me cryin, darlin'
Please don't let my tears fall in vain
Lord, I don't know what to do
You know my heart is filled with pain

Whoa, when you hear me howlin'
Baby, you know it hurts way down inside"
229,Led Zeppelin,"The night was black, rain fallin' down
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore
Afraid she's gone forever more
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
""Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea 
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
""Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear
There in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darlin', held her to me
Stole her away from the angry sea
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out ""she's mine to keep""
I saved my baby from an endless sleep.

Endless sleep, endless sleep [Repeat to Fade]"
230,Led Zeppelin,"You need cooling

231,Led Zeppelin,"Silent woman in the night, you came 
Took my seed from my shaking frame 
Same old fire, another flame 
And the wheel rolls on 

Silent woman through the flames, you come 
From the deep behind the sun 
Seems my nightmares, have just begun 
Left me barely holding on 

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand 
When we know the time has come 
Lose my senses, lose command 
Feel your healing rivers run 

Is it every time I fall 
That I think this is the one 
In the darkness can you hear me call 
Another day has just begun 
You babe

Silent woman, my face is changed 
Some know in ways to come 
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame 
And the wheels rolls on, rolls on"
232,Led Zeppelin,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
(If you want to get along) Well, make some money
(If you want to get along) Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey
(If you want to get along) You better give up some money
If you want to get along with me."
233,Led Zeppelin,"How many more times, treat me the way you wanna do
How many more times, treat me the way you wanna do
When I give you all my love, please, please be true

I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinkin' it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh lord, well I did it again
Now I've got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

Oh, Rosie, oh, girl, oh, Rosie, oh, yeah
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away, baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't you come for me, baby, steal away, alright, alright

Well, they call me the hunter, that's my name
Call me the hunter, that's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide, ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

How many more times, barrel house all night long
How many more times, barrel house all night long
Well I've got to get to you, baby, oh, please come home
Why don't you listen to me, babe
Why don't you please come home
Why don't you please come home
Why don't you please come home"
234,Led Zeppelin,"Her face is cracked from smiling 
All the fears that she's been hiding 
And it seems that pretty soon, everybody's gonna know

And her voice is sore from shouting 
Cheering winners who are losing 
And she worries if their days are few and soon they'll have to go

My, my, my, I'm so happy 
I'm gonna join the band 
We gonna dance and sing in celebration 
We are in the promised land 

She hears them talk of new ways 
To protect the home she lives in 
Then she wonders what it's all about when they break down the door. 

Her name is brown or white or black 
You know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell. 

My my my I'm so happy 
We gonna join the band 
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration 
We're in the promised land. 

Oh, there is a train that leaves the station 
Heading for your destination 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more
Yes, it has! 
And if you walk you're gonna get there 
And though it takes a little longer 
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan

Oh yeah, you'll moan
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, you'll moan, you'll moan

You're g-gone, you're g-gone, yeah-yea
You're g-gone
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my you are gone
You're gone

And when you see him in the distance you will wave your hand"
235,Led Zeppelin,"Oh baby it's cryin' time 
Oh baby I got to fly

Got to try to find a way 
Got to try to get away 

'Cause you know I gotta get away from you babe 
Oh baby the river's red, ah baby in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on 
I don't think I can hold out long

And when the owls cry in the night 
Oh baby, baby when the pines begin to cry 
Baby, baby, baby how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, mmm, baby, it's just a den 
For those who hide, who hide their love to depths of life 
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

And when the owls cry in the night 
And baby when the pines begin to cry 
Oh baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 

Baby how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
And they can't hold the wrath of those who walk
An' the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

239,Led Zeppelin,"I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted,
(And a) tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder,
Event I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me f*ck all

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

On the corner of Bleeker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver ran down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So I looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

oh oh oh oh

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah

I don't know where I'm gonna find it

Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?

Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right

Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right

So good, so good

Somebody please bring me down 

Hey, I love that little lady 
I got to be her fool

That's the way it should be,
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah all the good times we had,
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

As we walk down the country lanes,
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees,
Telling mother nature 'bout you and me

Well if the sunshine's so bright,
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

As we walk down the country lanes,
I'll be singing a song, Hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees,
Telling mother nature 'bout you and me

My, my la de la come on now it ain't too far,
Tell your friends all around the world,
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle
Come on now well let me tell you,
What you're missing, missing, 'round them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure,
It's a friendship so pure,
Angels singing all around My dog is so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my nat'ral life with you,
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim,
There ain't no old shep gonna happen again,
We'll still go walking down country lanes,
I'll sing the same old songs, hear me call your name"

Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right

There's an angel on my shoulder, in my hand a sword of gold 
Let me wander in your garden and the seeds of love I'll sow you know 

So the world is spinning faster are you dizzy when you're stoned 
Let the music be your master will you heed the master's call

Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor
To keep you from the gallows pole
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while

Riding a many mile
Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?

Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming
Riding a many mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him
Save me from the wrath of this man, man

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Pray tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many mile, mile, mile

An' though the course may change sometimes 
Rivers always reach the sea 
Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays 
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey 
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow 
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go 

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me 
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be 

Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad 
Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had 
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good 
'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would 

Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen 
Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen 
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow 
We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul 

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me 
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be 
Oh darlin', oh darlin' 

I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave

Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone"

I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball, uh uh, uh uh, yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way

I don't know, oh oh, yeah'

Ooh, yeah

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah!

It sure is fine!
Ah blow my mind!
When the tears are goin' down! 
Yeah! Yeah, yeah

Oh so, oh so, oh so good!
Oh so good!"
247,Led Zeppelin,"Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling 
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much, so much, so much

Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Really ought to know
I really ought to know
Oh
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should, you know I should"

Standing out in the cold 
Hey, babe, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through 
To the very depths of my soul, yeah 
Oh, baby, I just want to show you what I'd give you 
It is from every bend in the road 
Now listen to me 
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey 
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load 
Let me share your load, ooh, let me share, share your load 

And if you feel that you can't go on 
In the light you will find the road 

Hey, oh, though the winds of change may blow around you 
But that will always be so 
Wow-wow, wow-wow, when love is pain it can devour you 
If you are never alone 
I would share your load, I would share your load 
Baby, let me, oh, let me 

In the light 
Everybody needs the light 
In the light, in the light, in the light 

Light, light, light, in the light 
Light, light, light, in the light, oh, yeah 
Light, light, light, in the light"
249,Led Zeppelin,"Here's a tale of Tom 
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Always knew what's goin' on 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 

Worked for thirty years 
Sharing hopes and fears 
Dreamin' of the day 
He could turn and say 

Poor Tom, work's done, 
Been lazin' out in the noonday sun 

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 

His wife was Annie Mae 
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town 
She couldn't keep her dress down 

Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Always knew what's goin' on 

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 

And so it was one day 
People got to Annie Mae 
Tom stood, a gun in his hand 
And stopped her runnin' around 

Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Gotta die for what you've done 

All those years of work are thrown away 
To ease your mind is that all you can say? 

But what about that grandson on your knee? 
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

(Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom) 
Hey
(Keep-a truckin')"

That's why's I find it so hard to come back home to die

So many nights at the fireside, how my children's mother would cry, how my children's mother would cry
So many nights at the fireside, how my children's mother would cry
Cause I told the mother I had to say goodbye

Look over yonder, on the burying ground, on the burying ground
Look over yonder, on the burying ground

Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you baby, here I come again

Every day I work so hard
Bringin' home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away

Don't know where you're goin'
Only know just where you've been

Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill"
256,Led Zeppelin,"It was an April morning when they told us we should go
As I turn to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?

Oh, the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

Slipping off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole

Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground

Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowds, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone

If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow

Oh the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search?
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth

For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

258,Led Zeppelin,"Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all.
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley blow,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
Waiting for the eastern glow.
The apples of the valley hold,
The seas of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red.
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on.
Sing as you raise your bow,
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.
Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the mornin' light.
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back.
At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by,
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes."
259,Led Zeppelin,"I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play,
What did mama say to me

That's the way,
Oh, that's the way it ought to be,
Mama say that's the way it ought to stay, yeah, yeah oh oh

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river,
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes,
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying,
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers,
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters,
And all you do is stand and cry

I don't know what to say about it,
When all you ears have turned away,
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see,
Is that the way it ought to stay?
That's the way
That's the way it oughtta be
Oh don't you know now
Mama said, mama said, that's the way it's gonna stay, yeah, oh oh"
260,Led Zeppelin,"Ah-ah, ah!
Ah-ah, ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah-ah, ah!
Ah-ah, ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

I ain't gonna tell you nothin' but I do will, but I know, yeah
Now let me tell you 'bout my girl
Open up a newspaper and what do I see? Ahh, ah
See my girl, ah, looking at me
Ooh, and when she walks, she walks
Lemme tell ya, when she talks, she talks 
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord, I want to make her mine, yeah
Tell me baby what you want me to do?
And you want me to love you, love some other man too?
Ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no

She's the woman I really want to love and let me tell you more, ooh
She's my baby, lemme tell you, she lives next door
She's the one a-woman, the one a-woman that I know
I ain't going, I ain't going, I ain't going tell you 
I ain't going tell you one thing that you really ought to know, ooh
She's my lover, baby, and I love her so and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl!
And she's the kind of lover that makes me me fill the whole world and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, ooh
She's the kind of girl, I know what it's all about
Take it on, take it, take it, take it
Ah, excuse me
Oh, will ya excuse me
I'm just trying to find the bridge
Has anybody seen the bridge?
Please
Have you seen the bridge?
I ain't seen the bridge!
Where's that confounded bridge?"

When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman

So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
She don't make no rules

Oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness,
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
'Cause you can only blame yourself

Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Yeah, I need your love
I just got to have

Oh, it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, fortune
'Cause that's all that's left to you
Oh, it's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop, oh

Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I just got to have

Ooh, whatever that your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
'Cause that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh yeah, I need your love
I just got to have, I just got to have"
263,Led Zeppelin,"There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

Don't you want to cook it, cook it, cook it? 
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah

Ooh, heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned 
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground 
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand

But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby
Nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal 
Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow

And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show

I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Crazy ways are evident
In the way that you're wearing your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

You told your mamma I'd get you home
But you didn't say I had no car
I saw a lion he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only

And it's headed my way

Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And thoough our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I ain't tellin' no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
'T was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one 
Crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do, no

I guess I keep on rambling
I'm gonna, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing my song (I gotta find my baby)
I gotta ramble on, sing my song 
Gotta work my way around the world baby, baby
Ramble on, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, my baby
Doo, doo, doo, doo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo

I gotta keep searching for my baby 
(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
I gotta keep-a-searchin' for my baby 
(My, my, my, my, my, my, my baby)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
I can't find my bluebird 
I listen to my bluebird sing
I can't find my bluebird 
I keep rambling, baby
I keep rambling, baby"
269,Led Zeppelin,"One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

A man I know, went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers

Down on Bourbon street
You know it's right
You can see my friend,
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor
Doin' up my hair

New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White

One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite"

271,Led Zeppelin,"Hey fellas have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town?
It won't take long just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new but the face is the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart"

You didn't want me no more, yeah

You know, you must have one of them new fangled
New fangled back door man

273,Led Zeppelin,"If the sun refused to shine 
I would still be loving you 
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me 

Kind woman, I give you my all 
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain 
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by 
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die 
My, my, my inspiration is what you are to me 
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my world it smiles 
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles 
Thanks to you it will be done 
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad 
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine 
I would still be loving you 
Mountains crumble to the sea 
There will still be you and me"

And I'm shaking so much, really yearning

I watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around, 'round
And the clock on the wall's moving slower
Oh, my heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey, babe, ooh

Hand that ticks on the clock
Just don't seem to stop
When I'm thinking it over
Oh, tired of the light
I just don't seem to find
Have you wait, yeah played
Whoa, I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be with you, you
I gotta get it all, gotta get it all, gotta get it all
I've got to get all

And the palms of my hands getting wet, oh
I got no reason to doubt you baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey!
And the thoughts of a fool's gotta count
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah

Hey, now, oh, oh, oh
Light of the love that I found
